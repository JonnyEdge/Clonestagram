# React Clonestagram

React image upload and feed app. Should only be used in conjunction with the MCR Codes image API, which may or may not still be online by the time you are viewing this.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

Main Clonestagram navigation should load in all of its gaudy Comic Sans glory, but won't pull images, render cards or allow you to submit a new property without the MCR Codes API being active.
